            <img src="img/bio-pic.jpg" class="bio-pic">
            <p class="bio-text">In 2009, I was life-flighted to an Albuquerque hospital with a severe case of endocarditis (infection of the heart). My infection was so severe that two of my heart valves were completely destroyed. While waiting for surgery, I had to evaluate my life and what was really important. I had spent my life trying to be successful with my music, gaining fans, chasing fame, making money, the usual things us musicians focus on. I realized that even if I had sold millions of records or had made a fortune and accumulated all the "stuff" that I thought would make me content, I would have still been lying there dying, in a dark room in a hospital. I was scared. The kind of fear I had never felt before. Not scared of what would happen to me if I didn't make it through the surgery; I was saved by the blood of Jesus and was confident in where I was going. But scared of the unknown of my physical condition. I prayed, simple and short. I told God, "I don't want to be afraid anymore". He immediately gave me strength, and during the next month, I went through the worst time of my life. Thirteen hour open heart surgery, coughing up blood for days. The medicine triggered nightmares so bad I still get chills thinking about them. Having to relieve myself in a bottle for a month, losing 40 lbs., sobbing in the middle of the night because the pain was so intense. But I was never afraid. God knew my needs and provided His healing hand.</p><p class="bio-text">After I was released from the hospital, I decided that I needed to do something for others. I wrote songs about my experience and tried to sing them, but couldn't because of damage to my vocal chords. I kept trying, everyday my voice getting stronger and stronger. When my voice was about 75%, I was invited to lead worship for a ministry team for a week in Costa Rica. I went, sang, and I'm sure it didn't sound great, but I did it and was joyful. I went to Africa where my brother was pastoring a church. I got to play one of my songs during the service and was joyful.</p>
            <p class="bio-text">Later that year, I went to Austin, Texas to record an album. I recorded it and started playing in honky tonks and dive bars. The story of my struggles and God's strength slowly faded. I was focused once again on the things that I was focused on before my surgery. I was on auto-pilot.</p> 
            <p class="bio-text">Writing and playing in mediocre dance halls and to an audience who's only concern was getting drunk enough to forget about the previous work week. I wanted to forget about my story because it was painful to remember, but it seems God had a different plan for me. 
            Through conviction and the memories of the joy I had when I was being honest through my music, I decided to refocus my life and music on telling others my story. A story highlighting God's strength in our darkest times. While I write this, I still feel sick to my stomach recalling my time in the hospital. But God, knowing what I need to be happy is constantly reminding me that I need to use my talent that He gave me and the hard times I have been through to help others who are going though their own trials. The one thing I am sure of in this life is that God is my source of happiness even in unknown times. I want to share that with everyone, I want everyone to know the power of God like I know it. I have worked with multiple Grammy Award-winning musicians, I have toured the country with multiple bands and sang my songs around the world. None of that has brought me as much joy as sharing one song to someone who has needed it to give them faith to get through a trial they are going through.</p>
